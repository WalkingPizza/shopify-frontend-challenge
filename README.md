# Shopify Web Developer Intern Challenge

This application was created by Kevin Antonio Rateni Iatauro for January 2021 edition of the Shopify Web Developer Intern Challenge. It was made with :heart: and a tiny hint of sarcasm.

## Installation
Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the required packages, indicated in the ```package.json``` file.

```bash
npm install
```

## Dependencies

- [React 17.0.1](https://reactjs.org/), because even Facebook gets something right every once in a while.
- [Shopify Polaris 5.12](https://polaris.shopify.com/), because assigning a classname to a component to style it is overrated.
- [React Router 5.2.0](https://reactrouter.com/), so little use to this I don't even have something bad to say about it.
- [TypeScript 4.0.3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), because coding with JavaScript just can't happen if it's not harder than it should be.

## Future Work

Ideas I would have liked to implement, but decided not to for the time being.

- Calculate the average score of the five nominations picked by a user and define whether their selection is _Poor_, _Average_ or _Good_ depending on the range to which the average belongs. This should also serve as a way for users to understand how poor their taste in movies is, [_How Bad Is Your Spotify?_](https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/) docet.
- Migrate everything to functional components. Because they are the future today, but if Facebook has taught me anything with their A/B tests, everything's gonna change tomorrow.
- Shortening sharable links via [Cutt.ly](https://cutt.ly/)'s API. I know the current ones are ugly, I am sorry.
- Write tests with [Jest](jestjs.io). Future work because it is known that college students and recent graduates don't test.
